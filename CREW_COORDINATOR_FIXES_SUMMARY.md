## üîß Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. Fixed: Bins Not Emptying on Collection Completion ‚úÖ
**Problem:** When crew members marked a stop as "completed", bins were not being emptied automatically.

**Solution:** Added bin emptying logic to the crew controller's `updateStopStatus` function.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/controllers/crew.controller.js` (lines 310-316)

**Impact:**
- Bins are now automatically emptied when a crew member completes a bin collection stop
- Bin fill level is reset to 0
- `lastEmptied` timestamp is updated
- `collectionCount` is incremented

**API Endpoint:** `PUT /api/crew/routes/:routeId/stops/:stopIndex`

## üìù Notes

1. The old `/api/crew/issues` endpoint is still functional for backward compatibility but is deprecated.
2. All new issues should use `/api/issues` endpoint.
3. Bin emptying is automatic and requires no additional crew action.
4. Collection details (quantity, time) are optional but recommended for better analytics.
5. Issue comments support a maximum of 500 characters per comment.

---

## üéì Usage Examples

### For Crew Members:
```javascript
// Report an issue (no route required)
await crewApi.reportIssue({
  crewId: "user123",
  issueType: "bin-damaged",
  description: "Bin lid is broken and cannot close properly",
  location: "123 Main Street"
});

// Complete a stop with collection details
await crewApi.updateStopStatus(routeId, stopIndex, {
  status: "completed",
  notes: "Collected successfully",
  wasteQuantity: 45.5,
  collectionTime: 3
});
```

### For Coordinators:
```javascript
// Get all critical issues
const response = await coordinatorApi.getIssues({
  priority: "critical",
  status: "reported"
});

// Update issue status
await coordinatorApi.updateIssueStatus(issueId, {
  status: "resolved",
  resolvedBy: coordinatorId,
  resolution: "Bin replaced with new unit"
});

// Add comment to issue
await coordinatorApi.addIssueComment(issueId, {
  userId: coordinatorId,
  comment: "Contacted maintenance team for immediate repair"
});
```
